	This Project is on how  to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of your page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of your page, the design. You are really encouraged to fix your HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, you canâ€™t apply any design.
